## Developing

We have gone to great lengths to make developing Continuum as easy as possible. We use Gradle to automate just about everything. As long as you have Java 8 SDK running from source is a two step process:

- Clone the code or download a zip
- Run `gradlew game` (on Unixex, including macOS, run `./gradlew` everywhere you see `gradlew`) in the root of the project directory.

That's really it! If you want the project set up in IntelliJ (out favorite IDE) you run `gradlew idea` then load the generated project config. Then you get a bunch of run configurations and other stuff for free!
